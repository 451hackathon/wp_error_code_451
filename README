This plugin enables Wordpress users easily and transparently to block pages or posts when they get asked by a legal entity to do so.

== Description ==

This plugin aims at making it easier for Wordpress site administrators to mark pages or posts as being censored when they get asked by a legal entity to do so. So, instead of simply taking down the content, they will be able to mark it as censored and inform users about this very fact by adding the URL of the entity who ordered the takedown, as well as an optional description.

= What does the user see? =

On a single page, the user gets served a page telling them "Error 451 - unavailable for legal reasons", optionally it will display the blocking authority and a description.

What happens to a post in a loop? When in a category or archive, we will display altered post content und post title, so that censorship becomes visible.

= Report blocking to a crawler =

It's  possible to configure blocking to to a crawler by filling in the option in the backend.

= Allow users to ignore the block at their own risk =

Site admins can check a box which will allow visitors to see blocked content anyway, at their own risk.

= RFC =

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725

We serve two additional headers: blocked-by and blocking-authority.
blocked-by contains the domain, blocking-authority contains the URI to the authority that has requested the block.
The blocking-authority header is not yet in the RFC.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are you folks seriously making a censorship plugin? =

I know! We dislike censorship probably as much as you do. We designed this plugin to show that when censorship happens, it can be done in a transparent, limited, and legitimate manner.

= Is this legal to use in X country? =

Check with your local digital rights organisation!
