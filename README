# Wordpress plugin for Error Code 451

This plugin aims at making it easier for Wordpress site administrators to mark pages or posts as being censored when they get asked by a legal entity to do so. So, instead of simply taking down the content, they will be able to mark it as censored and inform users about this very fact by adding the URL of the entity who ordered the takedown, as well as an optional description.

## What does the user see?

On a single page, the user gets served a page telling them "Error 451 - unavailable for legal reasons", optionally it will display the blocking authority and a description.

What happens to a post in a loop? When in a category or archive, we will display altered post content und post title, so that censorship becomes visible.

## Report blocking to a crawler

It's  possible to configure blocking to to a crawler by filling in the option in the backend.

## Allow users to ignore the block at their own risk.

Site admins can check a box which will allow visitors to see blocked content anyway, at their own risk.

## RFC

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7725

 When an entity blocks access to a resource and returns status 451, it
 SHOULD include a "Link" HTTP header field [RFC5988] whose value is a
 URI reference [RFC3986] identifying itself.  When used for this
 purpose, the "Link" header field MUST have a "rel" parameter whose
 value is "blocked-by".

We serve two additional headers: blocked-by and blocking-authority.
blocked-by contains the domain, blocking-authority contains the URI to the authority that has requested the block.

## TODO
* Modify the Readme format to match Wordpress' requirements
* Make it possible to have the JSON filename as an option in the backend
* better verify if the plugin directory is writable for the JSON file to be written there.

## Ideas for improvement

* what about custom post formats?
* create a page/xml/sitemap will all blocked resources on the domain
  - Think about advertising the existence of the JSON file in wp_head ? -> but we don't have a spec for this, so it might not be that useful right now.
* scheduled block: add an expiry date for the block
* what if a page is blocked in two different countries for 2 different reasons?
